## Description
This repository contains a collection of coding exercises for the Software Development course. Each exercise focuses on a specific topic, allowing students to practice implementing various data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up the development environment and start working on the exercises:

1. Fork this repository to create your own copy.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local development environment.
3. Ensure you have the necessary build tools and dependencies installed.
4. Review the exercise descriptions and requirements in the respective exercise folders.
5. Implement the exercises in the provided `main.cpp` files.
6. Make regular commits and push your code to your forked repository.

## Exercise Structure
Each exercise folder contains the following files:

1. `main.cpp`: This file serves as the entry point for the exercise. Implement your code in this file based on the exercise requirements.
2. `README.md`: This file provides a detailed description of the exercise, including the problem statement, input/output specifications, and any additional notes.
3. Additional source files (if necessary): Some exercises may require additional source files, such as header files or utility functions. These files will be provided in the exercise folder if needed.

## Submitting Your Solutions
To submit your solutions for review, follow the steps below:

1. Push your changes to the respective exercise branch in your forked repository.
2. Open a pull request (PR) from your exercise branch to the main repository.
3. Fill out the pull request template, including a clear description of the exercise and any specific questions or notes.
4. Reviewers will provide feedback on your code and suggest any necessary improvements.
5. Iterate on your code based on the feedback received and make updates to your exercise branch.
6. The pull request will be merged into the main repository once the code meets the exercise requirements and passes the review process.

## Refactoring Session
Towards the end of the course, we will have a refactoring session where you can practice refactoring real examples from your own exercise repositories. Instructions for the refactoring session will be provided separately.

Happy coding!
